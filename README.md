# Shapefile Writer #


### Description ###
AMD Shapefile Writer for Web AppBuilder utilizing jszip to produce zipped shapefiles capable of being uploaded with Web AppBuilder. The module was designed for use as a WAB Feature Action, but may be applicable anywhere when handling geojson. Original source code was adapted to support multiple features with unique attributes, and to be more applicable to Web AppBuilder.

### Requirements ###
Shapefile Writer  was developed using Web AppBuilder v2.5, but should be compatible with older versions that support AMD.

### Installation ###
1. Copy shapefile-writer library into the libs folder of Web AppBuilder.
2. In jimu/exportUtils.js create a method utilizing existing methods that returns geojson (geojson to be utilized within a feature action).
```
EXAMPLE:

getGeoJsonForShpFile: function() {
        return this.getExportString()
      }
```
3. Create feature action that utilizes the newly created method to return geojson for use with the shapefile-writer library.
	- [Create Feature Action Documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/web-appbuilder/guide/create-a-feature-action-in-your-widget.htm)
4. Bring, into the new feature action, exportUtils, and the zipModule from the shapefile-writer library.
```
EXAMPLE:

define([
  'dojo/_base/declare',
  '../BaseFeatureAction',
  '../exportUtils',
  '../../libs/jszip/jszip',
  '../../libs/shp-write/zip'
], function(declare, BaseFeatureAction, exportUtils, jszip, zipMod){
  var clazz = declare(BaseFeatureAction, {
    name: 'ExportToShapefile',
    iconClass: 'icon-export',

    isFeatureSupported: function(featureSet){
      return featureSet.features.length > 0 && featureSet.features[0].geometry;
    },

    onExecute: function(featureSet){
      var ds = exportUtils.createDataSource({
        type: exportUtils.TYPE_FEATURESET,
        filename: 'features',
        data: featureSet
      });


      ds.setFormat(exportUtils.FORMAT_GEOJSON);

      ds.getGeoJsonForShpFile()
        .then(function(geojson) {
          var parsedGj = JSON.parse(geojson)

          return zipMod.zip(parsedGj)
      })
        .then(function(res) {

          saveAs(res, "ExportShp.zip")
        });
    }

  });
  return clazz;
});
```


### Usage ###
1. Utilizing the zip.js module, pass parsed geojson into the zip module's zip method (returns promise).
```
zipMod.zip(parsedStr)
```
2. Utilize WAB global saveAs method to save the zip file.
```
saveAs(res, "ExportShp.zip")
```

### Limitations ###

Currently supports 2D points, lines, and polygons.
